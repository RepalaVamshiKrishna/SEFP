3.  What are the requirements of the Bell System?
(i) It is important required that the capacity of the system be at least 60,000 calls per busy hour and preferably considerably
    more.
(ii)It needs to keep down the average number of cycles required to process each call.

4.  How new paths are selected on the basis of a memory image in switching networks?
    When new paths are to be selected in the switching network, an image of the network in the read/write memory,
    containing the busy/idle status of all links, is examined in order to find a new path. 

5.  What is signal processor data?
    This data, all of which is kept on a read/write store with appropriate back up on the read only store,
    consists of instructions for the signal processor and data necessary to control I/O actions.
